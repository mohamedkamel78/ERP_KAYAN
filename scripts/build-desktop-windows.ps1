.SYNOPSIS
  Builds the Windows desktop copy of KAYAN ERP: one folder that starts its own
  API server, with no terminal, no Node on PATH and no commands to type.

.DESCRIPTION
  The result is a folder (and a .zip beside it) shaped like this:

      KAYAN-ERP\
        erp_kayan.exe                 the program
        flutter_windows.dll, data\    the client runtime
        backend\dist\src\main.js      the API server
        backend\node_modules\         its libraries, production only
        backend\prisma\               the schema and its migrations
        backend\scripts\              database preparation
        backend\node\node.exe         a Node runtime that ships with the app

  Beside the folder it also produces KAYAN-ERP-windows.zip, and - when Inno
  Setup is installed on this machine - KAYAN-ERP-Setup-<version>.exe, the single
  file a customer double-clicks. Only the build machine needs Flutter, Node and
  (optionally) Inno Setup.

  Run this from the repository root, on a Windows machine, with Flutter and
  Node installed for *building* (the end user needs neither).

.PARAMETER Output
  Where to assemble. Default: build\desktop

.PARAMETER SkipZip
  Skip producing the .zip (assembly only).

.EXAMPLE
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\build-desktop-windows.ps1

KAYAN ERP - Windows desktop copy
================================

To run the program, double-click:   erp_kayan.exe

The program starts its own server on this machine. No terminal, no Node.js,
no commands.

What this copy needs on the machine
-----------------------------------
1. PostgreSQL, installed and running, holding the company's data.
   The program connects to the address written in:
       %APPDATA%\KAYAN-ERP\kayan.env
   That file is created automatically the first time the program runs, with
   fresh random signing keys. Edit it only if the database is somewhere else
   or uses a different password, then close the program completely and open
   it again.

2. That is all. Node.js, Flutter and Git are NOT needed on this machine.

If the program reports that the server did not start
----------------------------------------------------
Read the log, which is written to:
    %APPDATA%\KAYAN-ERP\logs\backend.log
The most common cause is PostgreSQL not running. Start it, then reopen the
program.

What is inside this folder
--------------------------
erp_kayan.exe          the program itself
data\                  its screens and translations
backend\dist\          the API server
backend\node_modules\  the server's libraries
backend\prisma\        the database schema and its migrations
backend\scripts\       the step that prepares the database
backend\node\node.exe  the Node runtime the server runs on

Nothing in this folder is a secret. The settings and the signing keys live in
%APPDATA%\KAYAN-ERP\ on the machine that runs it.
