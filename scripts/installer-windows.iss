; KAYAN ERP - the Windows installer definition.
;
; This file is data, not a program: the Inno Setup compiler (ISCC) reads it and
; produces the single file a customer runs:
;
;     KAYAN-ERP-Setup-<version>.exe
;
; The customer double-clicks that file, sees the usual Windows installer, and
; ends up with ERP_KAYAN in the Start menu. Nothing else is installed, nothing
; is downloaded, and no Node.js, Flutter, Git or terminal is involved.
;
; It packs the folder that scripts\build-desktop-windows.ps1 has already
; assembled (build\desktop\KAYAN-ERP), so the two steps stay separate: the build
; script decides WHAT ships, this file decides how it is installed.
;
; Inno Setup is free, is the standard for this job, and leaves no runtime
; dependency behind. The build script runs ISCC automatically when it is
; installed, and simply skips the installer when it is not.
