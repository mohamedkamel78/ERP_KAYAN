; KAYAN ERP - the Windows installer definition.
;
; This file is data, not a program: the Inno Setup compiler (ISCC) reads it and
; produces the single file a customer runs:
;
;     KAYAN-ERP-Setup-<version>.exe
;
; The customer double-clicks that file, sees the usual Windows installer, and
; ends up with ERP_KAYAN in the Start menu. Nothing else is installed, nothing
; is downloaded, and no Node.js, Flutter, Git or terminal is involved.
;
; It packs the folder that scripts\build-desktop-windows.ps1 has already
; assembled (build\desktop\KAYAN-ERP), so the two steps stay separate: the build
; script decides WHAT ships, this file decides how it is installed.
;
; Inno Setup is free, is the standard for this job, and leaves no runtime
; dependency behind. The build script runs ISCC automatically when it is
; installed, and simply skips the installer when it is not.

#define AppName "KAYAN ERP"
#define AppShortName "ERP_KAYAN"
#define AppExe "erp_kayan.exe"
#define AppVersion "1.0.0"
#define AppPublisher "KAYAN"
; Both are passed in by scripts\build-desktop-windows.ps1, so a custom -Output
; folder stays in step. The values below are used when ISCC is run by hand.

[Languages]
Name: "english"; MessagesFile: "compiler:Default.isl"
; Arabic ships as an *unofficial* Inno Setup translation, so a standard
; installation does not have it. Asking for a file that is not there makes
; ISCC fail outright, which would take the whole installer down with it: the
; language is offered when this machine has it, and the installer is still
; perfectly usable in English when it does not.
