.SYNOPSIS
  Checks a packaged Windows copy of KAYAN ERP before it reaches a customer.

.DESCRIPTION
  The build script assembles the folder; this script asks whether what it
  assembled is actually shippable. It needs no database, no server and no
  second machine - only the folder itself - so it can run on the build machine
  straight after the build, and again on any machine the folder is copied to.

  It answers the questions that matter for a standalone copy:
    * is everything a running program needs inside the folder?
    * does the bundled Node runtime actually run, on its own, from here?
    * is the server's entry point loadable by that runtime?
    * did any development secret, or any path from the machine that built it,
      travel inside the package?

  What it cannot check, because it needs Windows with a display and a database,
  is the program's own behaviour: that the window opens, that the server starts
  and that a person can sign in. Those are covered by tools\desktop_check.dart,
  which runs the real launcher against a real database, and by
  tools\desktop_package_check.sh, which does the same to a packaged folder.

.PARAMETER App
  The folder to check. Default: build\desktop\KAYAN-ERP

  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\verify-package.ps1
