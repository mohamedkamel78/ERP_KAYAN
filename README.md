# ERP_KAYAN

Cross-platform enterprise resource planning client (Flutter), targeting **Android,
iOS, Windows, macOS, Linux and Web** from a single codebase.

## Repository layout

| Path | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `lib/` | Flutter client (Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, Linux, Web) |
| `backend/` | NestJS API server — the only component that talks to the database |
| `docker-compose.yml` | Local / on-premise deployment of PostgreSQL + API |
| `DESIGN.md` | The design rules of the program, for Google Stitch and any designer |
| `docs/STITCH.md` | How a design made in Google Stitch reaches the program (Arabic) |
| `design/incoming/` | Drop exports from Stitch here |
| `docs/DESKTOP_WINDOWS.md` | The Windows copy that starts its own server (Arabic) |
| `scripts/build-desktop-windows.ps1` | Builds that copy: one folder that runs by itself |
| `scripts/installer-windows.iss` | Turns that folder into one Setup .exe a customer runs (Inno Setup) |
| `scripts/verify-package.ps1` | Asks whether a built copy is really shippable - no database needed |
| `.github/workflows/windows-package.yml` | Builds it on a real Windows machine and publishes the result |
| `tools/backend_shape_check.dart` | Proves the desktop and the web backend layer still agree |

The built Windows copy is published as a release, so nobody has to build it to
run it: <https://github.com/mohamedkamel78/ERP_KAYAN/releases>. The installer is
`KAYAN-ERP-Setup-1.0.0.exe`; the machine it lands on needs PostgreSQL and
nothing else. `docs/DESKTOP_WINDOWS.md` says what happens when it is opened.

## Status

**Backend:** working. Authentication (Argon2id + JWT access/refresh), company
and branch scoping, chart of accounts, and journal entries with server-side
double-entry validation, server-generated document numbers, posting, reversal
and an append-only audit trail. PostgreSQL schema with 14 tables and versioned
migrations.

**Client:** authentication, dashboard, chart of accounts (now reading from the
real API) and settings are wired. All other ERP modules are deliberately not
implemented — see "Pending business decisions".

## Architecture

Feature-first layout with an inner clean-architecture split per feature:

```

```

Rules the codebase follows:

- `domain` never imports `data` or `presentation`.
- Only `app/` composes features; features do not import each other's internals.
- The client never talks to a database. All data goes through the HTTP API.
- Money is never a `double` — client uses `Decimal`, server uses `numeric(19,4)`.
- The server enforces accounting rules; the client may hide UI but is never
  the control.

## Accounting core

`JournalEntry` enforces the double-entry invariant at construction time:

- at least two lines, all in the entry's single currency;
- a line is either a debit or a credit, never both, and never negative;
- `isBalanced` compares rounded totals, so sub-cent representation noise
  cannot mask — or fake — an imbalance;
- `post()` refuses an unbalanced entry; posted entries are corrected by
  generating a `reversal()`, never by editing.

These invariants are covered by unit tests.

## Localization

English and Arabic are first-class. Text direction follows the locale, so
switching to Arabic renders the entire application right-to-left. The choice
is persisted and can be reset to the system locale.

## Configuration

Nothing environment-specific is hardcoded. Configuration is injected at build
time:

```bash
flutter run \
  --dart-define=APP_ENV=development \
  --dart-define=API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080/api/v1
```

`APP_ENV` accepts `development`, `staging`, `production` or `onPremise`.
Seed (sample) data is enabled **only** in `development`; any other environment
always talks to the real API, and the interface displays a banner whenever
sample data is in use.

The client needs the API running. Full Windows instructions are in
[`backend/README.md`](backend/README.md); in short:

```bash
# terminal 1 — database and API
cd backend
npm install
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate deploy
npx ts-node prisma/seed.ts
npm run start:dev            # http://localhost:3000/api/v1

# terminal 2 — client
cd ..
flutter pub get
flutter gen-l10n             # regenerate translations after editing .arb files
flutter run -d chrome        # or: -d windows | -d macos | -d linux
```

Development sign-in: `admin` / `Admin@12345` — **change it before real use**.

The client never connects to PostgreSQL. Every read and write goes through the
API, which is the single source of truth.

## Quality gates

```bash
dart format --output=none --set-exit-if-changed .
flutter analyze
flutter test
flutter build web --release
```

All four currently pass: `flutter analyze` reports no issues and 60 tests pass.

## Pending business decisions

The following are intentionally not decided in code:

| Area | Question |
| --- | --- |
| Backend technology | **Decided:** NestJS + Prisma + PostgreSQL |
| Tax / VAT rules | Rate source, rounding and the treatment of returns. |
| Inventory costing | FIFO vs weighted average, and when COGS is recognised. |
| Fiscal calendar | Fiscal-year start and period-locking policy. |
| Document numbering | Scope (company/branch/year), gapless vs sequential-with-gaps. |
| Permissions model | Role catalogue and whether approval workflows are required. |
| Reporting | Required statutory reports and their layouts. |

The API is now the source of data. A local sample source still exists for
working on the interface without a server, but it is **opt-in and disabled by
default**; enable it only for development:

```bash
flutter run -d chrome --dart-define=USE_SEED_DATA=true
```

It is refused outside development builds, and the UI shows a banner whenever
it is active. It is never a system of record.
